/*10. Adding Comments:
Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t
have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name
and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the
program does.*/

/*6. Stripping Names:
Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of
the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name
once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white
spaces.*/
